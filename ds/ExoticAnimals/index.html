        <td>The Pacific Northwest tree octopus (Octopus paxarbolis) can be found in the temperate rainforests of the Olympic Peninsula on the west coast of North America.</td>

        <th>What is one interesting fact about it?</th>
        <td>Star-nosed moles can identify and eat food (bugs, mostly) in less than two-tenths of a second, taking a mere 8 milliseconds to decide whether an item is edible or not. They perform this feat in part due to the extremely efficient operation of their nervous systems, which convey information from the environment to the animal's brain at speeds approaching the physiological limit of neurons.</td>
        <td>They are found to be of 33 centimeters in length and 6 feet in diameter. However, they are believed to be shy and moves with their tentacles. This process is known as 'tentaculation'.</td>
